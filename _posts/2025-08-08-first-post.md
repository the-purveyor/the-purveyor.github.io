## Role of Conscientiousness in Economic Propsperity

Conscientiousness -- the quality of being dependable and disciplined -- leads to greater success, both professional as well as personal. People with more conscientiousness live long, fare well in career and marriage. As AI revolutionizes the homo-economicus, the benefits of conscientiousness also grows. The 'superpower' of being conscientious is more rewarding than ever: the more conscientious being uses AI as a tool to 'strengthen' their knowledge while the less conscientious one uses the AI for promoting moral-hazard.

If the benefits of conscientiousness is rising, why then the younger generation chooses to become less so? Is the older generation responsible for this trend? Is the unidimensional role of money to be held accountable?
