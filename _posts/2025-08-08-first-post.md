## Role of Conscientiousness in Economic Propsperity

Conscientiousness -- the quality of being dependable and disciplined -- leads to greater success, both professional as well as personal. People with more conscientiousness live long, fare well in career and marriage. As AI revolutionizes the homo-economicus, the benefits of conscientiousness also grows. The 'superpower' of being conscientious is more rewarding than ever: the more conscientious being uses AI as a tool to 'strengthen' their knowledge while the less conscientious one uses the AI for promoting moral-hazard.

If the benefits of conscientiousness is rising, why then the younger generation chooses to become less so (see the graph left in the above image)? Is this simply a passing phase and not to be read too much into? The rest of the graphs in the above figure are suggestive.

While conscientiousness is falling fast among young adults, neuroticism -- the experience of anxiety, worry, sadness -- is on the rise. Agreeableness -- the traits of compassion, cooperation and kindness -- is falling. Extraversion (read Extroversion in the US) -- the traits of sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness and seeking stimulation with others, including trusting and seeking help -- is on the decline.

Is the older generation responsible for this trend? Is the unidimensional role of money to be held accountable?
